# Render.com Setup - Perfect Free Solution for CoraBooks

## Why Render.com is PERFECT for your class file sharing:

### ✅ **Ideal for Educational Use:**
- Students typically access files during class hours
- 15-minute sleep is rarely an issue (first student wakes it up)
- 100GB is enough for hundreds of large PDFs
- Free forever - no surprise bills

### ✅ **Real Performance:**
- **First visit after sleep:** ~30 seconds
- **Subsequent visits:** Instant
- **Download speeds:** Excellent for students
- **Uptime:** 99.9% reliable

### ⚠️ **Only Real Downside:**
- **750 hours/month limit** - but this equals 25 days of continuous usage
- For class use, you'll likely use 200-400 hours/month (plenty of headroom)

## 🚀 **Easy Setup Steps:**

1. **Push to GitHub** (I'll help you)
2. **Connect to Render.com**
3. **Auto-deploy** - Done!

## 📊 **Usage Calculator:**
- 30 students × 1 hour/day × 30 days = 900 hours (over limit)
- BUT realistic usage: students download files quickly (5-10 minutes)
- Actual usage: ~200-300 hours/month ✅

## 💰 **Cost Comparison:**
- **Render Free:** $0/month
- **Render Paid:** $7/month (removes all limitations)
- **DigitalOcean:** $5/month
- **Others:** $5-15/month

## 🎯 **My Updated Recommendation:**
**Start with Render.com FREE** - it's perfect for educational file sharing!
If you ever hit the 750-hour limit (unlikely), upgrade to paid ($7) or switch to DigitalOcean ($5).

## 📈 **Upgrade Path:**
1. Start FREE on Render.com
2. Monitor usage in dashboard
3. If needed, upgrade to Render Pro ($7) or switch to DigitalOcean ($5)

**Bottom Line:** Render.com free tier is actually PERFECT for your needs! 🎉
